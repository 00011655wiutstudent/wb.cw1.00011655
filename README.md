The purpose of the current website is to show the skills and knowledge I have obtained during the first semester of the web technology module. To showcase my skills I have created a static website for the local brand “To’xtaniyoz ota” with 6 main pages and 6 subpages. The purpose of this static website would be to obtain describe the brand to clients and obtain new clients. For this website, all the images are presented from the official website of the company: https://www.facebook.com/toxtaniyozota/ , the official website of the company which is unfortunately poorly hosted, website: http://toxtaniyoz-ota.uz/ and one image was used from https://www.pexels.com/ . The first and home page of the website is home which was built in index.html. This page has a slideshow which works thanks to the code.js JavaSript file in total page has 3 images and the second and third image has text. About page has a fixed left sidebar with images and text and all the page components are relatively positioned. The production page is similar to the about page but here all the content is relatively positioned. Products page, for this page I have used a table to show an image gallery with text, and this page is only linked to 6 sub-pages that have a similar layout to the products page and are used for displaying product categories. News is the website's blog page and sidebar links to the brand’s social media. And the last page is the contact page which should have had some functionality but as we do not have a backend, the page is just showing the contact form.
